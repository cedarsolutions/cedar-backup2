      <title>What is Cedar Backup?</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup is a software package designed to manage system
         backups for a pool of local and remote machines.  Cedar Backup
         understands how to back up filesystem data as well as MySQL and
         PostgreSQL databases and Subversion repositories.  It can also be
         easily extended to support other kinds of data sources.
      </para>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup is focused around weekly backups to a single CD or DVD
         disc, with the expectation that the disc will be changed or
         overwritten at the beginning of each week.  If your hardware is new
         enough (and almost all hardware is today), Cedar Backup can write
         multisession discs, allowing you to add incremental data to a disc on
         a daily basis.
      </para>

      <para>
         Besides offering command-line utilities to manage the backup process,
         Cedar Backup provides a well-organized library of backup-related
         functionality, written in the Python programming language.
      </para>

      <para>
         There are many different backup software implementations out there in
         the free software and open source world. Cedar Backup aims to fill a
         niche: it aims to be a good fit for people who need to back up a
         limited amount of important data to CD or DVD on a regular basis.
         Cedar Backup isn't for you if you want to back up your MP3 collection
         every night, or if you want to back up a few hundred machines.
         However, if you administer a small set machines and you want to run
         daily incremental backups for things like system configuration,
         current email, small web sites, a CVS or Subversion repository, or a
         small MySQL database, then Cedar Backup is probably worth your time.
      </para>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup has been developed on a Debian GNU/Linux system and is
         primarily supported on Debian and other Linux systems.  However, since
         it is written in portable Python, it should run without problems on
         just about any UNIX-like operating system.  In particular, full Cedar
         Backup functionality is known to work on Debian and SuSE Linux
         systems, and client functionality is also known to work on FreeBSD and
         Mac OS X systems.
      </para>

      <para>
         To run a Cedar Backup client, you really just need a working Python
         installation.  To run a Cedar Backup master, you will also need a set
         of other executables, most of which are related to building and
         writing CD/DVD images.  A full list of dependencies is provided in 
         <xref linkend="cedar-install-source-deps"/>.

      <title>How to Get Support</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup is open source software that is provided to you at no
         cost.  It is provided with no warranty,  not even for MERCHANTABILITY
         or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  However, that said, someone can
         usually help you solve whatever problems you might see.  
      </para>
      
      <para>
         If you experience a problem, your best bet is to write the Cedar
         Backup Users mailing list.  <footnote><para>See 
         <quote>SF Mailing Lists</quote> at 
         <ulink url="http://cedar-backup.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para></footnote>
         This is a public list for all Cedar Backup users.  If you write to
         this list, you might get help from me, or from some other user who has
         experienced the same thing you have.  
      </para>
      
      <para>
         If you know that the problem you have found constitutes a bug, or
         if you would like to make an enhancement request, then feel free to
         file a bug report in the Cedar Solutions Bug Tracking System.  
         <footnote><para>See <quote>SF Bug Tracking</quote> 
         at <ulink url="http://cedar-backup.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para></footnote>
      </para>

      <para>
         If you are not comfortable discussing your problem in public or
         listing it in a public database, or if you need to send along
         information that you do not want made public, then you can write
         <email>support@cedar-solutions.com</email>.  That mail will go
         directly to me or to someone else who can help you.  If you write the
         support address about a bug, a <quote>scrubbed</quote> bug report will
         eventually end up in the public bug database anyway, so if at all
         possible you should use the public reporting mechanisms.  One of the
         strengths of the open-source software development model is its
         transparency.
      </para>

      <para>
         Regardless of how you report your problem, please try to provide as
         much information as possible about the behavior you observed and the
         environment in which the problem behavior occurred.
         <footnote><para>See Simon Tatham's excellent bug reporting tutorial:
         <ulink url="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html"/>
         .</para></footnote> 
      </para>
         
      <para>
         In particular, you should provide: the version of Cedar Backup that you
         are using; how you installed Cedar Backup (i.e. Debian package,
         source package, etc.); the exact command line that you executed; any
         error messages you received, including Python stack traces (if any);
         and relevant sections of the Cedar Backup log.  It would be even
         better if you could describe exactly how to reproduce the problem, for
         instance by including your entire configuration file and/or specific
         information about your system that might relate to the problem.
         However, please do <emphasis>not</emphasis> provide huge sections of
         debugging logs unless you are sure they are relevant or unless someone
         asks for them.
      </para>

      <tip>
         <para>
            Sometimes, the error that Cedar Backup displays can be rather
            cryptic.  This is because under internal error conditions, the text
            related to an exception might get propogated all of the way up to
            the user interface.  If the message you receive doesn't make much
            sense, or if you suspect that it results from an internal error,
            you might want to re-run Cedar Backup with the
            <option>--stack</option> option.  This forces Cedar Backup to dump
            the entire Python stack trace associated with the error, rather
            than just printing the last message it received.  This is good
            information to include along with a bug report, as well.

      <title>History</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup began life in late 2000 as a set of Perl scripts called
         <application>kbackup</application>.   These scripts met an immediate
         need (which was to back up skyjammer.com and some personal machines)
         but proved to be unstable, overly verbose and rather difficult to
         maintain.
      </para>

      <para>
         In early 2002, work began on a rewrite of
         <application>kbackup</application>.  The goal was to address many of
         the shortcomings of the original application, as well as to clean up
         the code and make it available to the general public.  While doing
         research related to code I could borrow or base the rewrite on, I
         discovered that there was already an existing backup package with the
         name <application>kbackup</application>, so I decided to change the
         name to <application>Cedar Backup</application> instead.
      </para>
         
      <para>
         Because I had become fed up with the prospect of maintaining a large
         volume of Perl code, I decided to abandon that language in favor of
         Python. <footnote><para>See <ulink url="http://www.python.org/"/>
         .</para></footnote> At the time, I chose Python mostly because I was
         interested in learning it, but in retrospect it turned out to be a
         very good decision.  From my perspective, Python has almost all of the
         strengths of Perl, but few of its inherent weaknesses (I feel that
         primarily, Python code often ends up being much more readable than
         Perl code).
      </para>

      <para>
         Around this same time, skyjammer.com and cedar-solutions.com were
         converted to run Debian GNU/Linux (potato) 
         <footnote><para>Debian's stable releases are named after characters
         in the Toy Story movie.</para></footnote>
         and I entered the Debian new maintainer queue, so I also made it a
         goal to implement Debian packages along with a Python source
         distribution for the new release.
      </para>

      <para>
         Version 1.0 of <application>Cedar Backup</application> was released in
         June of 2002.  We immediately began using it to back up skyjammer.com
         and cedar-solutions.com, where it proved to be much more stable than
         the original code.  Since then, we have continued to use Cedar
         Backup for those sites, and Cedar Backup has picked up a handful of
         other users who have occasionally reported bugs or requested minor
         enhancements.  
      </para>

      <para>
         In the meantime, I continued to improve as a Python programmer and
         also started doing a significant amount of professional development in
         Java.  It soon became obvious that the internal structure of
         <application>Cedar Backup</application> 1.0, while much better than
         <application>kbackup</application>, still left something to be
         desired.  In November 2003, I began an attempt at cleaning up the
         codebase.  I converted all of the internal documentation to use
         Epydoc, <footnote><para>Epydoc is a Python code documentation tool.
         See <ulink url="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para></footnote>
         and updated the code to use the newly-released Python logging package
         <footnote><para>See <ulink
         url="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-logging.html"/>
         .</para></footnote> after having a good experience with Java's log4j.
         However, I was still not satisfied with the code, which did not lend
         itself to the automated regression testing I had used when working
         with junit in my Java code.
      </para>

      <para>
         So, rather than releasing the cleaned-up code, I instead began another
         ground-up rewrite in May 2004.  With this rewrite, I applied
         everything I had learned from other Java and Python projects I had
         undertaken over the last few years.  I structured the code to take
         advantage of Python's unique ability to blend procedural code with
         object-oriented code, and I made automated unit testing a primary
         requirement.  The result is the 2.0 release, which is cleaner, more
         compact, better focused, and better documented than any release before
         it.  Utility code is less application-specific, and is now usable as a
         general-purpose library.  The 2.0 release also includes a complete
         regression test suite of over 3000 tests, which will help to ensure
         that quality is maintained as development continues into the future.
         <footnote><para>Tests are implemented using Python's unit test
         framework.  See <ulink url="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html"/>.</para></footnote>
