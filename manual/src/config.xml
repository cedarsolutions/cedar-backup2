      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>
         Configuring Cedar Backup is unfortunately
         somewhat complicated.  The good news is that once you get through the
         initial configuration process, you'll hardly ever have to change
         anything. Even better, the most typical changes (i.e. adding
         and removing directories from a backup) are easy.
      </para>

      <para>
         First, familiarize yourself with the concepts in 
         <xref linkend="cedar-basic"/>.  In particular, be sure that you understand
         the differences between a master and a client.  (If you only have one
         machine, then your machine will act as both a master and a client,
         and we'll refer to your setup as a <firstterm>pool of one</firstterm>.)
         Then, install Cedar Backup per the instructions in 
         <xref linkend="cedar-install"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
         Once everything has been installed, you are ready to begin configuring
         Cedar Backup.  Look over <xref linkend="cedar-commandline-cback"/> (in
         <xref linkend="cedar-commandline"/>) to become familiar with the
         command line interface.  Then, look over <xref
         linkend="cedar-config-configfile"/> (below) and create a configuration
         file for each peer in your backup pool.  To start with, create a very
         simple configuration file, then expand it later.  Decide now whether
         you will store the configuration file in the standard place
         (<filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename>) or in some other location.
      </para>

      <para>
         After you have all of the configuration files in place, configure each
         of your machines, following the instructions in the appropriate
         section below (for master, client or pool of one).  Since the master
         and client(s) must communicate over the network, you won't be able to
         fully configure the master without configuring each client and
         vice-versa.  The instructions are clear on what needs to be done.
      </para>

      <sidebar>

         <title>Which Platform?</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup has been designed for use on all UNIX-like systems.
            However, since it was developed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and
            because I am a Debian developer, the packaging is prettier and the
            setup is somewhat simpler on a Debian system than on a system where
            you install from source.  
         </para>

         <para>
            The configuration instructions below have been generalized so they
            should work well regardless of what platform you are running (i.e.
            RedHat, Gentoo, FreeBSD, etc.).  If instructions vary for a
            particular platform, you will find a note related to that
            platform.
         </para>

         <para>
            I am always open to adding more platform-specific hints and notes,
            so write me if you find problems with these instructions.
         </para>

      <title>Configuration File Format</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup is configured through an XML <footnote><para>See 
         <ulink url="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/98/10/guide0.html"/>
         for a basic introduction to XML.</para></footnote> configuration file,
         usually called <filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename>.  The configuration
         file contains the following sections: <firstterm>reference</firstterm>,
         <firstterm>options</firstterm>, <firstterm>collect</firstterm>,
         <firstterm>stage</firstterm>, <firstterm>store</firstterm>,
         <firstterm>purge</firstterm> and <firstterm>extensions</firstterm>.
      </para>

      <para>
         All configuration files must contain the two general configuration
         sections, the reference section and the options section.  Besides
         that, administrators need only configure actions they intend to use.
         For instance, on a client machine, administrators will generally only
         configure the collect and purge sections, while on a master machine
         they will have to configure all four action-related sections.
         <footnote><para>See <xref linkend="cedar-basic-process"/>, in <xref
         linkend="cedar-basic"/>.</para></footnote> The extensions section is
         always optional and can be omitted unless extensions are in use.
      </para>

      <note>
         <para>
            Even though the Mac OS X (darwin) filesystem is
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> case-sensitive, Cedar Backup configuration
            <emphasis>is</emphasis> generally case-sensitive on that platform,
            just like on all other platforms.  For instance, even though the
            files <quote>Ken</quote> and <quote>ken</quote> might be the same on the
            Mac OS X filesystem, an exclusion in Cedar Backup configuration for
            <quote>ken</quote> will only match the file if it is actually on
            the filesystem with a lower-case <quote>k</quote> as its first
            letter.  This won't surprise the typical UNIX user, but might
            surprise someone who's gotten into the <quote>Mac Mindset</quote>.
         </para>
      </note>

         <title>Sample Configuration File</title>

         <para>
            Both the Python source distribution and the Debian package come with a
            sample configuration file.  The Debian package includes a stripped
            config file in <filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename> and a larger
            sample in <filename>/usr/share/doc/cedar-backup2/examples/cback.conf.sample</filename>.
         </para>

         <para>
            This is a sample configuration file similar to the one provided in the
            source package.  Documentation below provides more information about
            each of the individual configuration sections.

                     not ask for any user input (which could hang the backup).
                     A common example is something like <command>/usr/bin/scp
                     -B</command>.

         <para>
            In order to actually execute the collect action, you must have
            configured at least one collect directory or one collect file.
            However, if you are only including collect configuration for use by
            an extension, then it's OK to leave out these sections.  The
            validation will take place only when the collect action is
            executed.

                     The ignore file is an indicator file.  If it exists in a

                     The ignore file provides a way for individual users (who
                     might not have access to Cedar Backup configuration) to
                     control which of their own directories get backed up.  For
                     instance, users with a <filename>~/tmp</filename>
                     directory might not want it backed up.  If they create an
                     ignore file in their directory (e.g.
                     <filename>~/tmp/.cbignore</filename>), then Cedar Backup
                     will ignore it.

            The stage configuration section contains configuration options
            related the the stage action.  The section defines the set of peers
            in a backup pool, and then also indicates where data from those
            peers should be staged to.

                     This is the directory into which the master stages collected
                     data from each of the clients.  Within the staging directory,
                     data is staged into date-based directories by peer name.  For
                     instance, peer <quote>daystrom</quote> backed up on 19 Feb 2005
                     would be staged into something like <filename>2005/02/19/daystrom</filename>
                     relative to the staging directory itself.

                     all of the various machines in a backup pool.  Many
                     administrators set up purging to keep staging directories
                     around for a week or more, which requires even more space.

                     This is a subsection which contains information about a
                     specific local client peer to be staged (backed up).  A

                     without requiring any rsh-based network calls.  It is
                     possible that a remote peer might be staged as a local
                     peer if its collect directory is mounted to the master via
                     NFS, AFS or some other method.

                              The rcp command should be the exact command used for
                              remote copies, including any required options.  If you are
                              using <command>scp</command>, you should pass it the

                  <para>
                     This value is required for both CD writers and DVD

                  <para>
                     This is the UNIX device name for the writer drive, for

                     In some cases, this device name is used to directly write
                     to media.  This is true all of the time for DVD writers,
                     and is true for CD writers when a SCSI id (see below) has

                  <para>
                     Besides this, the device name is also needed in order to

                     might already be mounted) as well as the post-write

                     If you have configured your CD writer hardware to work
                     through the normal filesystem device path, then you can
                     leave this parameter unset.  Cedar Backup will just use
                     the target device (above) when talking to
                     <command>cdrecord</command>.

                  <para>
                     Otherwise, if you have SCSI CD writer hardware or you have
                     configured your non-SCSI hardware to operate like a SCSI
                     device, then you need to provide Cedar Backup with a SCSI
                     id it can use when talking with
                     <command>cdrecord</command>.

                  <para>
                     For the purposes of Cedar Backup, a valid SCSI identifier
                     must either be in the standard SCSI identifier form
                     <literal>scsibus,target,lun</literal> or in the
                     specialized-method form

                  <para>
                     An example of a standard SCSI identifier is
                     <literal>1,6,2</literal>. Today, the two most common examples
                     of the specialized-method form are
                     <literal>ATA:scsibus,target,lun</literal> and
                     <literal>ATAPI:scsibus,target,lun</literal>, but you may
                     occassionally see other values (like
                     <literal>OLDATAPI</literal> in some forks of

                     speed-sensitive, it is probably best to set a sensible
                     value based on your specific writer and media.

                     running a consistency check against it.  If this check is
                     enabled, the contents of the staging directory are
                     directly compared to the media, and an error is reported
                     if there is a mismatch.

                     Practice shows that some drives can encounter an error

                     This consistency check allows us to catch the problem.
                     By default, the consistency check is disabled, but most
                     users should choose to enable it unless they have a good

                  <para>
                     By default, Cedar Backup does not check its media before
                     writing to it.  It will write to any media in the backup
                     device.  If you set this flag to Y, Cedar Backup will make
                     sure that the media has been initialized before writing to
                     it.  (Rewritable media is initialized using the initialize

                     warning would be generated if valid store data was only
                     found in the day before or day after the current day.

                     Under some circumstances, Cedar Backup ejects (opens and
                     closes) the writer device.  This is done because some
                     writer devices need to re-load the media before noticing a
                     media state change (like a new session).

                  <para>
                     For most writer devices this is safe, because they have a
                     tray that can be opened and closed.  If your writer device
                     does not have a tray <emphasis>and</emphasis> Cedar Backup
                     does not properly detect this, then set this flag.  Cedar
                     Backup will not ever issue an eject command to your
                     writer.

                     Note: this could cause problems with your backup.  For
                     instance, with many writers, the check data step may fail
                     if the media is not reloaded first.  If this happens to
                     you, you may need to get a different writer device.

                     When optimized blanking behavior has not been configured,
                     Cedar Backup uses a simplistic approach: rewritable media is blanked
                     at the beginning of every week, period.  
                  </para>
                  <para>
                     Since rewritable media can be blanked only a finite number
                     of times before becoming unusable, some users &mdash;
                     especially users of rewritable DVD media with its large
                     capacity &mdash; may prefer to blank the media less often.
                  </para>
                  <para>
                     If optimized blanking behavior is configured, Cedar Backup
                     will use a blanking factor and attempt to determine
                     whether future backups will fit on the current media.  If
                     it looks like backups will fit, then the media will not be
                     blanked.

                  <para>
                     There are two blanking modes: daily and weekly.  If the
                     weekly blanking mode is set, Cedar Backup will only
                     estimate future capacity (and potentially blank the disc)
                     once per week, on the starting day of the week.  If the
                     daily blanking mode is set, Cedar Backup will estimate
                     future capacity (and potentially blank the disc) every
                     time it is run.  <emphasis>You should only use the daily
                     blanking mode in conjunction with daily collect

                     data.</emphasis>

                     Cedar Backup estimates future capacity based on the

                     the following relationship is true:

         <para>
            The purge configuration section contains configuration options
            related the the purge action.  This section contains a set of
            directories to be purged, along with information about the schedule
            at which they should be purged.

         <para>
            Typically, Cedar Backup should be configured to purge collect
            directories daily (retain days of <literal>0</literal>).
         </para>

         <para>
            If you are tight on space, staging directories can also be purged
            daily.  However, if you have space to spare, you should consider
            purging about once per week.  That way, if your backup media is
            damaged, you will be able to recreate the week's backup using the
            rebuild action.
         </para>

         <para>
            You should also purge the working directory periodically, once
            every few weeks or once per month.  This way, if any unneeded files
            are left around, perhaps because a backup was interrupted or
            because configuration changed, they will eventually be removed.
            <emphasis>The working directory should not be purged any more
            frequently than once per week, otherwise you will risk destroying

         <title>Extensions Configuration</title>

         <para>
            The extensions configuration section is used to configure
            third-party extensions to Cedar Backup.  If you don't intend to use
            any extensions, or don't know what extensions are, then you can
            safely leave this section out of your configuration file.  It is
            optional.
         </para>

         <para>
            Extensions configuration is used to specify <quote>extended
            actions</quote> implemented by code external to Cedar Backup.  An
            administrator can use this section to map command-line Cedar
            Backup actions to third-party extension functions.
         </para>

         <para>
            Each extended action has a name, which is mapped to a Python
            function within a particular module.  Each action also has an index
            associated with it.  This index is used to properly order execution
            when more than one action is specified on the command line.
            The standard actions have predefined indexes, and extended actions
            are interleaved into the normal order of execution using those
            indexes.  The collect action has index 100, the stage index
            has action 200, the store action has index 300 and the purge
            action has index 400.
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Extended actions should always be configured to run
               <emphasis>before</emphasis> the standard action they are
               associated with.  This is because of the way indicator files are
               used in Cedar Backup.  For instance, the staging process
               considers the collect action to be complete for a peer if the
               file <filename>cback.collect</filename> can be found in that
               peer's collect directory.  
            </para>
            
            <para>
               If you were to run the standard collect action before your other
               collect-like actions, the indicator file would be written after
               the collect action completes but <emphasis>before</emphasis> all
               of the other actions even run.  Because of this, there's a
               chance the stage process might back up the collect directory
               before the entire set of collect-like actions have completed
               &mdash; and you would get no warning about this in your email!
            </para>
         </warning>
         
         <para>
            So, imagine that a third-party developer provided a Cedar
            Backup extension to back up a certain kind of database repository,
            and you wanted to map that extension to the <quote>database</quote>
            command-line action.  You have been told that this function is
            called <quote>foo.bar()</quote>.  You think of this backup as a
            <quote>collect</quote> kind of action, so you want it to be
            performed immediately before the collect action.
         </para>

         <para>
            To configure this extension, you would list an action with a name
            <quote>database</quote>, a module <quote>foo</quote>,
            a function name <quote>bar</quote> and an index of
            <quote>99</quote>.
         </para>

         <para>
            This is how the hypothetical action would be configured:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
&lt;extensions&gt;
   &lt;action&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;database&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;module&gt;foo&lt;/module&gt;
      &lt;function&gt;bar&lt;/function&gt;
      &lt;index&gt;99&lt;/index&gt;
   &lt;/action&gt;

      <title>Setting up a Pool of One</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup has been designed primarily for situations where there is
         a single master and a set of other clients that the master interacts
         with.  However, it will just as easily work for a single machine (a
         backup pool of one).
      </para>

      <para>
         Once you complete all of these configuration steps, your backups will
         run as scheduled out of cron. Any errors that occur will be reported
         in daily emails to your root user (or the user that receives root's
         email). If you don't receive any emails, then you know your backup
         worked.
      </para>

      <para>
         Note: all of these configuration steps should be run as the root user,
         unless otherwise indicated.
      </para>

      <tip>
         <para>
            This setup procedure discusses how to set up Cedar Backup in the
            <quote>normal case</quote> for a pool of one.  If you would like to
            modify the way Cedar Backup works (for instance, by ignoring the
            store stage and just letting your backup sit in a staging
            directory), you can do that.  You'll just have to modify the
            procedure below based on information in the remainder of the
            manual.
         </para>
      </tip>

      <sect2>

         <title>Step 1: Decide when you will run your backup.</title>

         <para>
            There are four parts to a Cedar Backup run: collect, stage, store
            and purge. The usual way of setting off these steps is through a
            set of cron jobs.  Although you won't create your cron jobs just
            yet, you should decide now when you will run your backup so you are
            prepared for later.
         </para>

         <para>
            Backing up large directories and creating ISO filesystem images can
            be intensive operations, and could slow your computer down
            significantly. Choose a backup time that will not interfere with
            normal use of your computer.  Usually, you will want the backup to
            occur every day, but it is possible to configure cron to execute
            the backup only one day per week, three days per week, etc.
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Because of the way Cedar Backup works, you must ensure that your
               backup <emphasis>always</emphasis> runs son the first day of your
               configured week.  This is because Cedar Backup will only clear
               incremental backup information and re-initialize your media when
               running on the first day of the week.  If you skip running Cedar
               Backup on the first day of the week, your backups will likely be
               <quote>confused</quote> until the next week begins, or until you
               re-run the backup using the <option>--full</option> flag.

         <title>Step 2: Make sure email works.</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup relies on email for problem notification.  This
            notification works through the magic of cron.  Cron will email any
            output from each job it executes to the user associated with the
            job.  Since by default Cedar Backup only writes output to the
            terminal if errors occur, this ensures that notification emails
            will only be sent out if errors occur.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            In order to receive problem notifications, you must make sure that
            email works for the user which is running the Cedar Backup cron
            jobs (typically root).  Refer to your distribution's documentation
            for information on how to configure email on your system.  Note
            that you may prefer to configure root's email to forward to some
            other user, so you do not need to check the root user's mail in
            order to see Cedar Backup errors.

         <title>Step 3: Configure your writer device.</title>

         <para>
            Before using Cedar Backup, your writer device must be properly
            configured.  If you have configured your CD/DVD writer hardware to
            work through the normal filesystem device path, then you just need
            to know the path to the device on disk (something like
            <filename>/dev/cdrw</filename>).  Cedar Backup will use the this
            device path both when talking to a command like
            <command>cdrecord</command> and when doing filesystem operations
            like running media validation.
         </para>

         <para>
            Your other option is to configure your CD writer hardware like a SCSI
            device (either because it <emphasis>is</emphasis> a SCSI device or
            because you are using some sort of interface that makes it look
            like one).  In this case, Cedar Backup will use the SCSI id when
            talking to <command>cdrecord</command> and the device path when
            running filesystem operations.
         </para>

         <para>
            See <xref linkend="cedar-config-writer"/> for more information on
            writer devices and how they are configured.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               There is no need to set up your CD/DVD device if you have
               decided not to execute the store action.
            </para>

            <para>
                Due to the underlying utilities that Cedar Backup uses, the
                SCSI id may only be used for CD writers,
                <emphasis>not</emphasis> DVD writers.

         <title>Step 4: Configure your backup user.</title>

         <para>
             Choose a user to be used for backups. Some platforms may
             come with a <quote>ready made</quote> backup user. For other
             platforms, you may have to create a user yourself. You may
             choose any id you like, but a descriptive name such as
             <literal>backup</literal> or <literal>cback</literal> is a good
             choice.  See your distribution's documentation for information on
             how to add a user.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               Standard Debian systems come with a user named
               <literal>backup</literal>.  You may choose to stay with this
               user or create another one.

      <sect2>

         <title>Step 5: Create your backup tree.</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup requires a backup directory tree on disk. This
            directory tree must be roughly three times as big as the amount of
            data that will be backed up on a nightly basis, to allow for the
            data to be collected, staged, and then placed into an ISO filesystem
            image on disk. (This is one disadvantage to using Cedar Backup in
            single-machine pools, but in this day of really large hard drives,
            it might not be an issue.) Note that if you elect not to purge the
            staging directory every night, you will need even more space.
         </para>

         <para>
            You should create a collect directory, a staging directory and a
            working (temporary) directory. One recommended layout is this:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
/opt/
     backup/
            collect/
            stage/
            tmp/
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            If you will be backing up sensitive information (i.e. password
            files), it is recommended that these directories be owned by the
            backup user (whatever you named it), with permissions
            <literal>700</literal>. 
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               You don't have to use <filename>/opt</filename> as the root of your
               directory structure.  Use anything you would like.  I use
               <filename>/opt</filename> because it is my <quote>dumping
               ground</quote> for filesystems that Debian does not manage.
            </para>

            <para>
               Some users have requested that the Debian packages set up a more
               <quote>standard</quote> location for backups right
               out-of-the-box.  I have resisted doing this because it's
               difficult to choose an appropriate backup location from within
               the package.  If you would prefer, you can create the backup
               directory structure within some existing Debian directory such
               as <filename>/var/backups</filename> or
               <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.

         <title>Step 6: Create the Cedar Backup configuration file.</title>

         <para>
            Following the instructions in <xref
            linkend="cedar-config-configfile"/> (above) create a configuration
            file for your machine.  Since you are working with a pool of one,
            you must configure all four action-specific sections: collect,
            stage, store and purge.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            The usual location for the Cedar Backup config file is
            <filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename>.  If you change the location,
            make sure you edit your cronjobs (below) to point the
            <command>cback</command> script at the correct config file (using
            the <option>--config</option> option).
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Configuration files should always be writable only by root
               (or by the file owner, if the owner is not root).
            </para>

            <para>
               If you intend to place confidental information into the Cedar
               Backup configuration file, make sure that you set the filesystem
               permissions on the file appropriately.  For instance, if you
               configure any extensions that require passwords or other similar
               information, you should make the file readable only to root or
               to the file owner (if the owner is not root).

         <para>
            Use the command <command>cback validate</command> to validate your

         <title>Step 9: Modify the backup cron jobs.</title>

         <para>
            Since Cedar Backup should be run as root, one way to configure the
            cron job is to add a line like this to your
            <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> file:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
30 00 * * * root  cback all
         </programlisting>
                          
         <para>
            Or, you can create an executable script containing just these lines
            and place that file in the <filename>/etc/cron.daily</filename>
            directory:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
#/bin/sh
cback all
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            You should consider adding the <option>--output</option> or
            <option>-O</option> switch to your <command>cback</command>
            command-line in cron.  This will result in larger logs, but could
            help diagnose problems when commands like
            <command>cdrecord</command> or <command>mkisofs</command> fail
            mysteriously.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               For general information about using cron, see the manpage for

            </para>

            <para>
               On a Debian system, execution of daily backups is controlled by
               the file <filename>/etc/cron.d/cedar-backup2</filename>.  As
               installed, this file contains several different settings, all
               commented out.  Uncomment the <quote>Single machine (pool of
               one)</quote> entry in the file, and change the line so that the
               backup goes off when you want it to.

      <title>Setting up a Client Peer Node</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup has been designed to backup entire <quote>pools</quote>
         of machines.  In any given pool, there is one master and some number
         of clients.  Most of the work takes place on the master, so
         configuring a client is a little simpler than configuring a master.
      </para>

      <para>
         Backups are designed to take place over an RSH or SSH connection.
         Because RSH is generally considered insecure, you are encouraged to
         use SSH rather than RSH. This document will only describe how to
         configure Cedar Backup to use SSH; if you want to use RSH, you're on
         your own. 
      </para>

      <para>
         Once you complete all of these configuration steps, your backups will
         run as scheduled out of cron. Any errors that occur will be reported
         in daily emails to your root user (or the user that receives root's
         email). If you don't receive any emails, then you know your backup
         worked.
      </para>

      <para>
         Note: all of these configuration steps should be run as the root user,
         unless otherwise indicated.

         <title>Step 1: Decide when you will run your backup.</title>

         <para>
            There are four parts to a Cedar Backup run: collect, stage, store
            and purge. The usual way of setting off these steps is through a
            set of cron jobs.  Although you won't create your cron jobs just
            yet, you should decide now when you will run your backup so you are
            prepared for later.
         </para>

         <para>
            Backing up large directories and creating ISO filesystem images can be
            intensive operations, and could slow your computer down
            significantly. Choose a backup time that will not interfere with
            normal use of your computer.  Usually, you will want the backup to
            occur every day, but it is possible to configure cron to execute
            the backup only one day per week, three days per week, etc.
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Because of the way Cedar Backup works, you must ensure that your
               backup <emphasis>always</emphasis> runs on the first day of your
               configured week.  This is because Cedar Backup will only clear
               incremental backup information and re-initialize your media when
               running on the first day of the week.  If you skip running Cedar
               Backup on the first day of the week, your backups will likely be
               <quote>confused</quote> until the next week begins, or until you
               re-run the backup using the <option>--full</option> flag.

         <title>Step 2: Make sure email works.</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup relies on email for problem notification.  This
            notification works through the magic of cron.  Cron will email any
            output from each job it executes to the user associated with the
            job.  Since by default Cedar Backup only writes output to the
            terminal if errors occur, this neatly ensures that notification
            emails will only be sent out if errors occur.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            In order to receive problem notifications, you must make sure that
            email works for the user which is running the Cedar Backup cron
            jobs (typically root).  Refer to your distribution's documentation
            for information on how to configure email on your system.  Note
            that you may prefer to configure root's email to forward to some
            other user, so you do not need to check the root user's mail in
            order to see Cedar Backup errors.

         <para>
             Choose a user to be used for backups. Some platforms may come with
             a "ready made" backup user. For other platforms, you may have to
             create a user yourself. You may choose any id you like, but a
             descriptive name such as <literal>backup</literal> or
             <literal>cback</literal> is a good choice.  See your
             distribution's documentation for information on how to add a user.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               Standard Debian systems come with a user named
               <literal>backup</literal>.  You may choose to stay with this
               user or create another one.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
             Once you have created your backup user, you must create an SSH
             keypair for it. Log in as your backup user, and then run the
             command <command>ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa</command>:
         </para>

         <programlisting>

         </programlisting>

         <para>
            The default permissions for this directory should be fine.
            However, if the directory existed before you ran
            <command>ssh-keygen</command>, then you may need to modify the
            permissions.  Make sure that the <filename>~/.ssh</filename>
            directory is readable only by the backup user (i.e. mode
            <literal>700</literal>), that the
            <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa</filename> file is only readable and
            writable only by the backup user (i.e. mode <literal>600</literal>)
            and that the <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</filename> file is
            writable only by the backup user (i.e. mode <literal>600</literal>
            or mode <literal>644</literal>).
         </para>

         <para>
            Finally, take the master's public SSH identity (which you found in
            step 2) and cut-and-paste it into the file
            <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>.  Make sure the
            identity value is pasted into the file <emphasis>all on one
            line</emphasis>, and that the <filename>authorized_keys</filename>
            file is owned by your backup user and has permissions
            <literal>600</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            If you have other preferences or standard ways of setting up your
            users' SSH configuration (i.e. different key type, etc.), feel free
            to do things your way.  The important part is that the master must
            be able to SSH into a client <emphasis>with no password entry
            required</emphasis>.

         <title>Step 5: Create your backup tree.</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup requires a backup directory tree on disk. This
            directory tree must be roughly as big as the amount of data that
            will be backed up on a nightly basis (more if you elect not to
            purge it all every night).
         </para>

         <para>
            You should create a collect directory and a working (temporary)
            directory. One recommended layout is this:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
/opt/
     backup/
            collect/
            tmp/
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            If you will be backing up sensitive information (i.e. password
            files), it is recommended that these directories be owned by the
            backup user (whatever you named it), with permissions
            <literal>700</literal>. 
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               You don't have to use <filename>/opt</filename> as the root of your
               directory structure.  Use anything you would like.  I use
               <filename>/opt</filename> because it is my <quote>dumping
               ground</quote> for filesystems that Debian does not manage.
            </para>

            <para>
               Some users have requested that the Debian packages set up a more
               "standard" location for backups right out-of-the-box.  I have
               resisted doing this because it's difficult to choose an
               appropriate backup location from within the package.  If you
               would prefer, you can create the backup directory structure
               within some existing Debian directory such as
               <filename>/var/backups</filename> or
               <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.

            must configure all action-specific sections for the collect and
            purge actions.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            The usual location for the Cedar Backup config file is
            <filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename>.  If you change the location,
            make sure you edit your cronjobs (below) to point the
            <command>cback</command> script at the correct config file (using
            the <option>--config</option> option).
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Configuration files should always be writable only by root
               (or by the file owner, if the owner is not root).
            </para>

            <para>
               If you intend to place confidental information into the Cedar
               Backup configuration file, make sure that you set the filesystem
               permissions on the file appropriately.  For instance, if you
               configure any extensions that require passwords or other similar
               information, you should make the file readable only to root or
               to the file owner (if the owner is not root).

         <programlisting>
30 00 * * * root  cback collect
30 06 * * * root  cback purge
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            You should consider adding the <option>--output</option> or
            <option>-O</option> switch to your <command>cback</command>
            command-line in cron.  This will result in larger logs, but could
            help diagnose problems when commands like
            <command>cdrecord</command> or <command>mkisofs</command> fail
            mysteriously.
         </para>

         <para>
            You will need to coordinate the collect and purge actions on the
            client so that the collect action completes before the master
            attempts to stage, and so that the purge action does not begin
            until after the master has completed staging.  Usually, allowing an
            hour or two between steps should be sufficient.  <footnote

            Cedar Backup relies on email for problem notification.  This
            notification works through the magic of cron.  Cron will email any
            output from each job it executes to the user associated with the
            job.  Since by default Cedar Backup only writes output to the
            terminal if errors occur, this neatly ensures that notification
            emails will only be sent out if errors occur.
         </para>
            
         <para>
            In order to receive problem notifications, you must make sure that
            email works for the user which is running the Cedar Backup cron
            jobs (typically root).  Refer to your distribution's documentation
            for information on how to configure email on your system.  Note
            that you may prefer to configure root's email to forward to some
            other user, so you do not need to check the root user's mail in
            order to see Cedar Backup errors.

         <title>Step 3: Configure your writer device.</title>

         <para>
            Before using Cedar Backup, your writer device must be properly
            configured.  If you have configured your CD/DVD writer hardware to
            work through the normal filesystem device path, then you just need
            to know the path to the device on disk (something like
            <filename>/dev/cdrw</filename>).  Cedar Backup will use the this
            device path both when talking to a command like
            <command>cdrecord</command> and when doing filesystem operations
            like running media validation.
         </para>

         <para>
            Your other option is to configure your CD writer hardware like a SCSI
            device (either because it <emphasis>is</emphasis> a SCSI device or
            because you are using some sort of interface that makes it look
            like one).  In this case, Cedar Backup will use the SCSI id when
            talking to <command>cdrecord</command> and the device path when
            running filesystem operations.
         </para>

         <para>
            See <xref linkend="cedar-config-writer"/> for more information on
            writer devices and how they are configured.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               There is no need to set up your CD/DVD device if you have
               decided not to execute the store action.
            </para>

            <para>
                Due to the underlying utilities that Cedar Backup uses, the
                SCSI id may only be used for CD writers,
                <emphasis>not</emphasis> DVD writers.

             Choose a user to be used for backups. Some platforms may come with
             a <quote>ready made</quote> backup user. For other platforms, you
             may have to create a user yourself. You may choose any id you
             like, but a descriptive name such as <literal>backup</literal> or
             <literal>cback</literal> is a good choice.  See your
             distribution's documentation for information on how to add a user.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               Standard Debian systems come with a user named
               <literal>backup</literal>.  You may choose to stay with this

         </note>

         <para>
             Once you have created your backup user, you must create an SSH
             keypair for it. Log in as your backup user, and then run the
             command <command>ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa</command>:

         <para>
            The default permissions for this directory should be fine.
            However, if the directory existed before you ran
            <command>ssh-keygen</command>, then you may need to modify the
            permissions.  Make sure that the <filename>~/.ssh</filename>
            directory is readable only by the backup user (i.e. mode
            <literal>700</literal>), that the
            <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa</filename> file is only readable and
            writable by the backup user (i.e. mode <literal>600</literal>) and
            that the <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</filename> file is writable
            only by the backup user (i.e. mode <literal>600</literal> or mode

         <para>
            If you have other preferences or standard ways of setting up your
            users' SSH configuration (i.e. different key type, etc.), feel free
            to do things your way.  The important part is that the master must

         <title>Step 5: Create your backup tree.</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup requires a backup directory tree on disk. This
            directory tree must be roughly large enough hold twice as much data
            as will be backed up from the entire pool on a given night, plus
            space for whatever is collected on the master itself. This will
            allow for all three operations - collect, stage and store - to have
            enough space to complete. Note that if you elect not to purge the
            staging directory every night, you will need even more space.
         </para>

         <para>
            You should create a collect directory, a staging directory and a
            working (temporary) directory. One recommended layout is this:
         </para>

         <programlisting>
/opt/
     backup/
            collect/
            stage/
            tmp/
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            If you will be backing up sensitive information (i.e. password
            files), it is recommended that these directories be owned by the
            backup user (whatever you named it), with permissions
            <literal>700</literal>. 
         </para>

         <note>

            <para>
               You don't have to use <filename>/opt</filename> as the root of your
               directory structure.  Use anything you would like.  I use
               <filename>/opt</filename> because it is my <quote>dumping
               ground</quote> for filesystems that Debian does not manage.
            </para>

            <para>
               Some users have requested that the Debian packages set up a more
               <quote>standard</quote> location for backups right
               out-of-the-box.  I have resisted doing this because it's
               difficult to choose an appropriate backup location from within
               the package.  If you would prefer, you can create the backup
               directory structure within some existing Debian directory such
               as <filename>/var/backups</filename> or
               <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.

         <title>Step 6: Create the Cedar Backup configuration file.</title>

         <para>
            Following the instructions in 
            <xref linkend="cedar-config-configfile"/> (above), create a
            configuration file for your machine.  Since you are working with a
            master machine, you would typically configure all four
            action-specific sections: collect, stage, store and purge.
         </para>

         <note>
            <para>
               Note that the master can treat itself as a <quote>client</quote>
               peer for certain actions.  As an example, if you run the collect
               action on the master, then you will stage that data by
               configuring a local peer representing the master.
            </para>

            <para>
               Something else to keep in mind is that you do not really have to
               run the collect action on the master.  For instance, you may
               prefer to just use your master machine as a <quote>consolidation
               point</quote> machine that just collects data from the other
               client machines in a backup pool.  In that case, there is no
               need to collect data on the master itself.
            </para>
         </note>
            
         <para>
            The usual location for the Cedar Backup config file is
            <filename>/etc/cback.conf</filename>.  If you change the location,
            make sure you edit your cronjobs (below) to point the
            <command>cback</command> script at the correct config file (using
            the <option>--config</option> option).
         </para>

         <warning>
            <para>
               Configuration files should always be writable only by root
               (or by the file owner, if the owner is not root).
            </para>

            <para>
               If you intend to place confidental information into the Cedar
               Backup configuration file, make sure that you set the filesystem
               permissions on the file appropriately.  For instance, if you
               configure any extensions that require passwords or other similar
               information, you should make the file readable only to root or
               to the file owner (if the owner is not root).

         <para>
            Use the command <command>cback validate</command> to validate your
            configuration file. This command checks that the configuration file

            problems, such as invalid CD/DVD device entries.  This command
            <emphasis>only</emphasis> validates configuration on the master,
            not any clients that the master might be configured to connect to.
         </para>

         <para>
            Note: the most common cause of configuration problems is in not

            This step must wait until after your client machines have been at

            configured on the client machine(s) in a pool, attempt an SSH
            connection to each client. 
         </para>
            
         <para>
            Log in as the backup user on the master, and then use the command
            <command>ssh user@machine</command> where
            <replaceable>user</replaceable> is the name of backup user
            <emphasis>on the client machine</emphasis>, and
            <replaceable>machine</replaceable> is the name of the client
            machine.
         </para>

         <para>
            If you are able to log in successfully to each client without
            entering a password, then things have been configured properly.
            Otherwise, double-check that you followed the user setup
            instructions for the master and the clients.

         <title>Step 9: Test your backup.</title>

         <para>
             Make sure that you have configured all of the clients in your
             backup pool. On all of the clients, execute <command>cback --full
             collect</command>.  (You will probably have already tested this
             command on each of the clients, so it should succeed.)
         </para>

         <para>
            When all of the client backups have completed, place a valid CD/DVD
            disc in your drive, and then use the command <command>cback --full
            all</command>.  You should execute this command as root.  If the
            command completes with no output, then the backup was run
            successfully. 
         </para>

         <para>
            Just to be sure that everything worked properly, check the logfile
            (<filename>/var/log/cback.log</filename>) on the master and each of
            the clients, and also mount the CD/DVD disc on the master to
            be sure it can be read.
         </para>

         <para>
            You may also want to run <command>cback purge</command> on the
            master and each client once you have finished validating that
            everything worked.

         <title>Step 10: Modify the backup cron jobs.</title>

         <para>
            Since Cedar Backup should be run as root, you should add a set of
            lines like this to your <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> file:

30 06 * * * root  cback purge
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            You should consider adding the <option>--output</option> or
            <option>-O</option> switch to your <command>cback</command>
            command-line in cron.  This will result in larger logs, but could
            help diagnose problems when commands like
            <command>cdrecord</command> or <command>mkisofs</command> fail
            mysteriously.

         <para>
            You will need to coordinate the collect and purge actions on
            clients so that their collect actions complete before the master
            attempts to stage, and so that their purge actions do not begin
            until after the master has completed staging.  Usually, allowing
            an hour or two between steps should be sufficient.

            <para>
               On a Debian system, execution of daily backups is controlled by

      <sect2>

         <title>Device Types</title>

         <para>
            In order to execute the store action, you need to know how to
            identify your writer device.  Cedar Backup supports two kinds of
            device types: CD writers and DVD writers.  DVD writers are always
            referenced through a filesystem device name (i.e.
            <filename>/dev/dvd</filename>).  CD writers can be referenced
            either through a SCSI id, or through a filesystem device name.
            Which you use depends on your operating system and hardware.
         </para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

         <title>Devices identified by by device name</title>

         <para>
            For all DVD writers, and for CD writers on certain platforms, you
            will configure your writer device using only a device name.  If
            your writer device works this way, you should just specify
            &lt;target_device&gt; in configuration.  You can either leave
            &lt;target_scsi_id&gt; blank or remove it completely.  The writer
            device will be used both to write to the device and for filesystem
            operations &mdash; for instance, when the media needs to be mounted
            to run the consistency check.
         </para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

         <title>Devices identified by SCSI id</title>

         <para>
            Cedar Backup can use devices identified by SCSI id only when
            configured to use the <literal>cdwriter</literal> device type.
         </para>

         <para>
            In order to use a SCSI device with Cedar Backup, you must know both the
            SCSI id &lt;target_scsi_id&gt; and the device name
            &lt;target_device&gt;.  The SCSI id will be used to write to media
            using <command>cdrecord</command>; and the device name will be used
            for other filesystem operations.
         </para>

         <para>
            A true SCSI device will always have an address
            <literal>scsibus,target,lun</literal> (i.e.
            <literal>1,6,2</literal>).  This should hold true on most UNIX-like
            systems including Linux and the various BSDs (although I do not
            have a BSD system to test with currently).  The SCSI address
            represents the location of your writer device on the one or more
            SCSI buses that you have available on your system.  
         </para>

         <para>
            On some platforms, it is possible to reference non-SCSI writer
            devices (i.e. an IDE CD writer) using an emulated SCSI id.  If you
            have configured your non-SCSI writer device to have an emulated
            SCSI id, provide the filesystem device path in
            &lt;target_device&gt; and the SCSI id in &lt;target_scsi_id&gt;,
            just like for a real SCSI device.
         </para>

         <para>
            You should note that in some cases, an emulated SCSI id takes the
            same form as a normal SCSI id, while in other cases you might see a
            method name prepended to the normal SCSI id (i.e.
            <quote>ATA:1,1,1</quote>).

         <title>Linux Notes</title>

         <para>
            On a Linux system, IDE writer devices often have a emulated SCSI
            address, which allows SCSI-based software to access the device through
            an IDE-to-SCSI interface.  Under these circumstances, the first IDE
            writer device typically has an address <literal>0,0,0</literal>.  However,
            support for the IDE-to-SCSI interface has been deprecated and is not
            well-supported in newer kernels (kernel 2.6.x and later).
         </para> 

         <para>
            Newer Linux kernels can address <firstterm>ATA</firstterm> or
            <firstterm>ATAPI</firstterm> drives without SCSI emulation by
            prepending a <quote>method</quote> indicator to the emulated
            device address.  For instance, <literal>ATA:0,0,0</literal> or
            <literal>ATAPI:0,0,0</literal> are typical values.
         </para>

         <para>
            However, even this interface is deprecated as of late 2006, so with
            relatively new kernels you may be better off using the filesystem
            device path directly rather than relying on any SCSI emulation.

         <title>Finding your Linux CD Writer</title>

         <para>
            Here are some hints about how to find your Linux CD writer
            hardware.  First, try to reference your device using the filesystem
            device path:
         </para>

         <screen>
cdrecord -prcap dev=/dev/cdrom
         </screen>

         <para>
            Running this command on my hardware gives output that looks like
            this (just the top few lines):
         </para>
         
         <screen>
Device type    : Removable CD-ROM
Version        : 0
Response Format: 2
Capabilities   : 
Vendor_info    : 'LITE-ON '
Identification : 'DVDRW SOHW-1673S'
Revision       : 'JS02'
Device seems to be: Generic mmc2 DVD-R/DVD-RW.

Drive capabilities, per MMC-3 page 2A:
         </screen>

         <para>
            If this works, and the identifying information at the top of the
            output looks like your CD writer device, you've probably found a
            working configuration.  Place the device path into
            &lt;target_device&gt; and leave &lt;target_scsi_id&gt; blank.
         </para>

         <para>
            If this doesn't work, you should try to find an ATA or ATAPI
            device:
         </para>

         <screen>
cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATA
cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATAPI
         </screen>

         <para>
            On my development system, I get a result that looks something like
            this for ATA:
         </para>

         <screen>
scsibus1:
        1,0,0   100) 'LITE-ON ' 'DVDRW SOHW-1673S' 'JS02' Removable CD-ROM
        1,1,0   101) *
        1,2,0   102) *
        1,3,0   103) *
        1,4,0   104) *
        1,5,0   105) *
        1,6,0   106) *
        1,7,0   107) *
         </screen>

         <para>
            Again, if you get a result that you recognize, you have again
            probably found a working configuraton.  Place the associated device
            path (in my case, <literal>/dev/cdrom</literal>) into
            &lt;target_device&gt; and put the emulated SCSI id
            (in this case, <literal>ATA:1,0,0</literal>) into &lt;target_scsi_id&gt;.
         </para>

         <para>
            Any further discussion of how to configure your CD writer hardware
            is outside the scope of this document.  If you have tried the hints
            above and still can't get things working, you may want to reference
            the <citetitle>Linux CDROM HOWTO</citetitle> 
            (<ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/CDROM-HOWTO"/>)

         <title>Mac OS X Notes</title>

         <para>
            On a Mac OS X (darwin) system, things get strange.  Apple has
            abandoned traditional SCSI device identifiers in favor of a
            system-wide resource id.  So, on a Mac, your writer device will
            have a name something like <literal>IOCompactDiscServices</literal>
            (for a CD writer) or <literal>IODVDServices</literal> (for a DVD
            writer).  If you have multiple drives, the second drive probably
            has a number appended, i.e. <literal>IODVDServices/2</literal> for
            the second DVD writer.  You can try to figure out what the name of
            your device is by grepping through the output of the command
            <command>ioreg -l</command>.<footnote><para>Thanks to the
            file README.macosX in the cdrtools-2.01+01a01 source tree
            for this information</para></footnote>
         </para>

         <para>
            Unfortunately, even if you can figure out what device to use, I
            can't really support the store action on this platform.  In OS X,
            the <quote>automount</quote> function of the Finder interferes
            significantly with Cedar Backup's ability to mount and unmount
            media and write to the CD or DVD hardware.  The Cedar Backup writer
            and image functionality does work on this platform, but the effort
            required to fight the operating system about who owns the media and
            the device makes it nearly impossible to execute the store action
            successfully.
         </para>

         <para>
            If you are interested in some of my notes about what works and what
            doesn't on this platform, check out the documentation in the
            <filename>doc/osx</filename> directory in the source distribution.
