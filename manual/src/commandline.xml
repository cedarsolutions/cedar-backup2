      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>
         Cedar Backup comes with three command-line programs:
         <command>cback</command>, <command>cback-amazons3-sync</command>, and
         <command>cback-span</command>.  
      </para>
         
      <para>
         The <command>cback</command> command is the primary command line
         interface and the only Cedar Backup program that most users will ever
         need.  
      </para>

      <para>
         The <command>cback-amazons3-sync</command> tool is used for
         synchronizing entire directories of files up to an Amazon S3 cloud
         storage bucket, outside of the normal Cedar Backup process. 
      </para>

      <para>
         Users who have a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of data to back up &mdash;
         more than will fit on a single CD or DVD &mdash; can use the
         interactive <command>cback-span</command> tool to split their data
         between multiple discs.

         <para>
            Cedar Backup's primary command-line interface is the
            <command>cback</command> command.  It controls the entire
            backup process.

         <title>Syntax</title>

         <para>
            The <command>cback</command> command has the following syntax:
         </para>

         <screen>
 Usage: cback [switches] action(s)

 The following switches are accepted:

   -h, --help         Display this usage/help listing
   -V, --version      Display version information
   -b, --verbose      Print verbose output as well as logging to disk
   -q, --quiet        Run quietly (display no output to the screen)
   -c, --config       Path to config file (default: /etc/cback.conf)
   -f, --full         Perform a full backup, regardless of configuration
   -M, --managed      Include managed clients when executing actions
   -N, --managed-only Include ONLY managed clients when executing actions
   -l, --logfile      Path to logfile (default: /var/log/cback.log)
   -o, --owner        Logfile ownership, user:group (default: root:adm)
   -m, --mode         Octal logfile permissions mode (default: 640)
   -O, --output       Record some sub-command (i.e. cdrecord) output to the log
   -d, --debug        Write debugging information to the log (implies --output)
   -s, --stack        Dump a Python stack trace instead of swallowing exceptions
   -D, --diagnostics  Print runtime diagnostics to the screen and exit

 The following actions may be specified:

   all                Take all normal actions (collect, stage, store, purge)
   collect            Take the collect action
   stage              Take the stage action
   store              Take the store action
   purge              Take the purge action
   rebuild            Rebuild "this week's" disc if possible
   validate           Validate configuration only
   initialize         Initialize media for use with Cedar Backup

 You may also specify extended actions that have been defined in
 configuration.

 You must specify at least one action to take.  More than one of
 the "collect", "stage", "store" or "purge" actions and/or
 extended actions may be specified in any arbitrary order; they
 will be executed in a sensible order.  The "all", "rebuild",
 "validate", and "initialize" actions may not be combined with
 other actions.
         </screen>

         <para>
            Note that the all action <emphasis>only</emphasis> executes the
            standard four actions.  It never executes any of the configured
            extensions.  <footnote><para>Some users find this surprising,
            because extensions are configured with sequence numbers.  I did it
            this way because I felt that running extensions as part of the all
            action would sometimes result in <quote>surprising</quote>
            behavior.  Better to be definitive than confusing.</para></footnote>

                     just propagating last message it received back up to the

            This might be a good option for some types of data, as long as you
            understand the limitations around retrieving previous versions of
            objects that get modified or deleted as part of a sync.  S3 does
            support versioning, but it won't be quite as easy to get at those
            previous versions as with an explicit incremental backup like
            <command>cback</command> provides.  Cedar Backup does not provide
            any tooling that would help you retrieve previous versions.

            The underlying functionality relies on the 
            <ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/">AWS CLI</ulink> toolset.
            Before you use this extension, you need to set up your Amazon S3
            account and configure AWS CLI as detailed in Amazons's 
            <ulink url="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">setup guide</ulink>.
            The <command>aws</command> will be executed as the same user that

            make sure you configure it as the proper user.  (This is different
            than the amazons3 extension, which is designed to execute as root
            and switches over to the configured backup user to execute AWS CLI
            commands.)

         <screen>
 Usage: cback-amazons3-sync [switches] sourceDir s3bucketUrl

 Cedar Backup Amazon S3 sync tool.

 This Cedar Backup utility synchronizes a local directory to an Amazon S3
 bucket.  After the sync is complete, a validation step is taken.  An
 error is reported if the contents of the bucket do not match the
 source directory, or if the indicated size for any file differs.
 This tool is a wrapper over the AWS CLI command-line tool.

 The following arguments are required:

   sourceDir            The local source directory on disk (must exist)
   s3BucketUrl          The URL to the target Amazon S3 bucket

 The following switches are accepted:

   -h, --help           Display this usage/help listing
   -V, --version        Display version information
   -b, --verbose        Print verbose output as well as logging to disk
   -q, --quiet          Run quietly (display no output to the screen)
   -l, --logfile        Path to logfile (default: /var/log/cback.log)
   -o, --owner          Logfile ownership, user:group (default: root:adm)
   -m, --mode           Octal logfile permissions mode (default: 640)
   -O, --output         Record some sub-command (i.e. aws) output to the log
   -d, --debug          Write debugging information to the log (implies --output)
   -s, --stack          Dump Python stack trace instead of swallowing exceptions
   -D, --diagnostics    Print runtime diagnostics to the screen and exit
   -v, --verifyOnly     Only verify the S3 bucket contents, do not make changes
   -w, --ignoreWarnings Ignore warnings about problematic filename encodings

 Typical usage would be something like:

   cback-amazons3-sync /home/myuser s3://example.com-backup/myuser

 This will sync the contents of /home/myuser into the indicated bucket.

                     The AWS CLI S3 sync process is very picky about filename
                     encoding.  Files that the Linux filesystem handles with no
                     problems can cause problems in S3 if the filename cannot be
                     encoded properly in your configured locale.  As of this
                     writing, filenames like this will cause the sync process
                     to abort without transferring all files as expected.

                  <para>
                     To avoid confusion, the <command>cback-amazons3-sync</command> 
                     tries to guess which files in the source directory will
                     cause problems, and refuses to execute AWS CLI S3 sync if
                     any problematic files exist.  If you'd rather proceed
                     anyway, use <option>--ignoreWarnings</option>.

                     If problematic files are found, then you have basically

                     set <literal>LANG=C</literal>) or rename the file so it
                     can be encoded properly in your locale. The error messages
                     will tell you the expected encoding (from your locale) and
                     the actual detected encoding for the filename.

         <para>
            Cedar Backup was designed &mdash; and is still primarily focused
            &mdash; around weekly backups to a single CD or DVD.  Most users
            who back up more data than fits on a single disc seem to stop their
            backup process at the stage step, using Cedar Backup as an
            easy way to collect data.  
         </para>

         <para>
            However, some users have expressed a need to write these large
            kinds of backups to disc &mdash; if not every day, then at least
            occassionally.  The <command>cback-span</command> tool was written
            to meet those needs.  If you have staged more data than fits on a
            single CD or DVD, you can use <command>cback-span</command> to
            split that data between multiple discs.
         </para>

         <para>
            <command>cback-span</command> is not a general-purpose
            disc-splitting tool.  It is a specialized program that requires
            Cedar Backup configuration to run.  All it can do is read Cedar
            Backup configuration, find any staging directories that have not
            yet been written to disc, and split the files in those directories
            between discs.
         </para>

         <para>
            <command>cback-span</command> accepts many of the same command-line
            options as <command>cback</command>, but <emphasis>must</emphasis>
            be run interactively.  It cannot be run from cron.  This is
            intentional.  It is intended to be a useful tool, not a new part of
            the backup process (that is the purpose of an extension).
         </para>

         <para>
            In order to use <command>cback-span</command>, you must configure
            your backup such that the largest individual backup file can fit on
            a single disc.  <emphasis>The command will not split a single file
            onto more than one disc.</emphasis>  All it can do is split large
            directories onto multiple discs.  Files in those directories will
            be arbitrarily split up so that space is utilized most efficiently.

         <para>
            As discussed above, the <command>cback-span</command> is an
            interactive command.  It cannot be run from cron.

         <para>
            You can typically use the default answer for most questions.
            The only two questions that you may not want the default answer
            for are the fit algorithm and the cushion percentage.  
         </para>

         <para>
            The cushion percentage is used by <command>cback-span</command> to
            determine what capacity to shoot for when splitting up your staging
            directories.  A 650 MB disc does not fit fully 650 MB of data.
            It's usually more like 627 MB of data.  The cushion percentage
            tells <command>cback-span</command> how much overhead to reserve
            for the filesystem.  The default of 4% is usually OK, but if you
            have problems you may need to increase it slightly.
         </para>

         <para>
            The fit algorithm tells <command>cback-span</command> how it
            should determine which items should be placed on each disc.  
            If you don't like the result from one algorithm, you can reject
            that solution and choose a different algorithm.

                     The worst-fit algorithm proceeds through a sorted list

                     out of items or meeting capacity exactly.  If capacity is
                     exceeded, the item that caused capacity to be exceeded is
                     thrown away and the next one is tried.  The algorithm
                     effectively includes the maximum number of items possible
                     in its search for optimal capacity utilization.  It tends
                     to be somewhat slower than either the best-fit or
                     alternate-fit algorithm, probably because on average it
                     has to look at more items before completing.

                     The best-fit algorithm proceeds through a sorted list of
                     items (sorted from largest to smallest) until running out
                     of items or meeting capacity exactly.  If capacity is
                     exceeded, the item that caused capacity to be exceeded is
                     thrown away and the next one is tried.  The algorithm
                     effectively includes the minimum number of items possible
                     in its search for optimal capacity utilization.  For large
                     lists of mixed-size items, it's not unusual to see the
                     algorithm achieve 100% capacity utilization by including
                     fewer than 1% of the items.  Probably because it often has
                     to look at fewer of the items before completing, it tends
                     to be a little faster than the worst-fit or alternate-fit
                     algorithms.

                     The first-fit algorithm proceeds through an unsorted list
                     of items until running out of items or meeting capacity
                     exactly.  If capacity is exceeded, the item that caused
                     capacity to be exceeded is thrown away and the next one is
                     tried.  This algorithm generally performs more poorly than
                     the other algorithms both in terms of capacity utilization
                     and item utilization, but can be as much as an order of
                     magnitude faster on large lists of items because it
                     doesn't require any sorting.

                     from the start and end of a sorted list (sorted from

                     the number of items it considers on average before
                     completing.  It often achieves slightly better capacity

================================================
           Cedar Backup 'span' tool
================================================

This the Cedar Backup span tool.  It is used to split up staging
data when that staging data does not fit onto a single disc.

This utility operates using Cedar Backup configuration.  Configuration
specifies which staging directory to look at and which writer device
and media type to use.

Continue? [Y/n]: 
===

Cedar Backup store configuration looks like this:

   Source Directory...: /tmp/staging
   Media Type.........: cdrw-74
   Device Type........: cdwriter
   Device Path........: /dev/cdrom
   Device SCSI ID.....: None
   Drive Speed........: None
   Check Data Flag....: True
   No Eject Flag......: False

Is this OK? [Y/n]: 
===

Please wait, indexing the source directory (this may take a while)...
===

The following daily staging directories have not yet been written to disc:

   /tmp/staging/2007/02/07
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/08
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/09
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/10
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/11
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/12
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/13
   /tmp/staging/2007/02/14

The total size of the data in these directories is 1.00 GB.

Continue? [Y/n]: 
===

Based on configuration, the capacity of your media is 650.00 MB.

Since estimates are not perfect and there is some uncertainly in
media capacity calculations, it is good to have a "cushion",
a percentage of capacity to set aside.  The cushion reduces the
capacity of your media, so a 1.5% cushion leaves 98.5% remaining.

What cushion percentage? [4.00]: 
===

The real capacity, taking into account the 4.00% cushion, is 627.25 MB.
It will take at least 2 disc(s) to store your 1.00 GB of data.

Continue? [Y/n]: 
===

Which algorithm do you want to use to span your data across
multiple discs?

The following algorithms are available:

   first....: The "first-fit" algorithm
   best.....: The "best-fit" algorithm
   worst....: The "worst-fit" algorithm
   alternate: The "alternate-fit" algorithm

If you don't like the results you will have a chance to try a
different one later.

Which algorithm? [worst]: 
===

Please wait, generating file lists (this may take a while)...
===

Using the "worst-fit" algorithm, Cedar Backup can split your data
into 2 discs.

Disc 1: 246 files, 615.97 MB, 98.20% utilization
Disc 2: 8 files, 412.96 MB, 65.84% utilization
