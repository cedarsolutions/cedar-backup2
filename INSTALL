This module is distributed in standard Python distutils form.  Use:

   python setup.py --help 

For more information on how to install it.  You must have a Python
interpreter version 2.5 or better to use these modules.  Some external
tools are also required for certain features to work.  See the user 
manual for more details.

In the simplest case, you will probably just use:

   python setup.py install

to install to your standard Python site-packages directory.  Note that on 
UNIX systems, you will probably need to do this as root.

The documentation and unit tests provided with this distribution are not
installed by setup.py.  You may put them wherever you would like.

You may wish to run the unit tests before actually installing anything.
Run them like so:

   python util/test.py

If any unit test reports a failure on your system, please email me the
output from the unit test, so I can fix the problem.  Please make sure
to include the diagnostic information printed out at the beginning of
the test run.
