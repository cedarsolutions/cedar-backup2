SECURITY FIXES

* Take Matthias Urlichs' suggestions about how to make MySQL extension more secure.


FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY

* We should probably check the staging flag and refuse to stage if it's already been done...?
* Add a config value or option for indicating whether backed-up files should be logged (if anyone cares).
* Implement capacity mode functionality, i.e. what to do with a full disc. (bug #6)
* Implement "safe overwrite" functionality based on disc label, and give users a way to label a disc (bug #5)
* Prevent two backups from running against the same config file (?)
* Make incremental backup safer if full is missed, i.e. "expire" incremental stuff after a week? (bug #6)
* Somehow figure out if a full backup (i.e. disc-restart) has been missed (bug #6)
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two extensions with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two peers with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).


TESTING IMPROVEMENTS

* Create unit tests for the store/rebuild "find directories" functions in action.py (and maybe refactor)
* Come up with non-PyUnit code to stress test high-level actions, etc. 


DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

Add documentation for new pre- and post-action hooks.

Documentation in some places is difficult to read, especially in the config section.

Add documentation for some common debugging methods (like how to find your CD drive)

Julie has some ideas for how I can fix it.  In particular, she suggests that I shouldn't
duplicate description unless I have to (i.e. ignore file in two places) and she suggets
that I be clearer (or at least more consistent) in the way I discuss whether a field is
optional, required, can be repeated, etc.

Julie also thinks that I may be able to rework the setup sections (master and client)
to avoid duplication.  There is a lot of duplication there, but I'm kind of at a loss
as to the best way to present it to the user.  I'm not sure if it's better to have
completely different sections or one section with "if master, do this, if client do this"
in it.
