FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY

* Hrm, the 'umount -l' functionality probably is Linux-specific, and that >= 2.4.11 or better as well.
* Add in notes on configuration interface for extensions if they want 3rd parties to be able to deal with their configuration.
* We should probably check the staging flag and refuse to stage if it's already been done...?
* Add a config value or option for indicating whether backed-up files should be logged (if anyone cares).
* Implement capacity mode functionality, i.e. what to do with a full disc. (bug #6)
* Implement "safe overwrite" functionality based on disc label, and give users a way to label a disc (bug #5)
* Prevent two backups from running against the same config file (?)
* Make incremental backup safer if full is missed, i.e. "expire" incremental stuff after a week? (bug #6)
* Somehow figure out if a full backup (i.e. disc-restart) has been missed (bug #6)
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two extensions with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two peers with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).


TESTING IMPROVEMENTS

* Create unit tests for the store/rebuild "find directories" functions in action.py (and maybe refactor)
* Come up with non-PyUnit code to stress test high-level actions, etc. 


DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

Documentation in some places is difficult to read, especially in the config section.

Julie has some ideas for how I can fix it.  In particular, she suggests that I shouldn't
duplicate description unless I have to (i.e. ignore file in two places) and she suggets
that I be clearer (or at least more consistent) in the way I discuss whether a field is
optional, required, can be repeated, etc.

Julie also thinks that I may be able to rework the setup sections (master and client)
to avoid duplication.  There is a lot of duplication there, but I'm kind of at a loss
as to the best way to present it to the user.  I'm not sure if it's better to have
completely different sections or one section with "if master, do this, if client do this"
in it.

Typo in "all" action's description:

    Extensions can be executed as part of the all action. If you need to execute an 
    extended action, you must specify the other actions you want to run individually 
    on the command line.

The "can" should be "can't".

Some things from Dag Rende:

   I miss some things in the documentation:
     * how to restore from the backups when they are needed - small hints on
       how to find the right files or the rigth subversion backup.
     * how to act when changing CD. It should be possible to force a full
       backup after each removal of CD, to keep each CD an indepenedent
       backup set (not needing multiple CDs to restore a file). It would be
       impractical to take the CD just before each full backup.
     * clarification on how to use extensions
          * where in the config file the two xml elements should be and on
            what level (I guessed and it worked)
          * that the all action doesn't include extensions (it should I
            think, especially when there is a sequence number that puts the
            extension action in the right order)

Change documentation on Subversion, since it seems to work for both FSFS and
BDB.  Maybe another class that just changes the backend-type?
