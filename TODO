# Project  : Cedar Backup, release 2
# Revision : $Id$
# Purpose  : TODO list for package

* Change sort order of parameters, classes within modules, etc. where needed in Epydoc
* Implement a removeUnchanged() method on the backup files list, taking same as its digest output
* Put a check somewhere (not in the CD writer) to make sure the device isn't mounted
* PurgeItemList needs to match up better with requirements of purge stage (i.e. way to purge files of a certain age)
* We maybe do want the default mkisofs "add a dir means add just its contents" behavior?  Maybe with a switch?
* Decide whether some other classes can benefit from the property() functionality (MediaCapacity, for instance, could be
  changed to only allow get and could validate that we have a tuple of integers, etc.; MediaDescription could be changed to
  only allow access to its elements, etc., etc.)
