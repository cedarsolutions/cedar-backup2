ITEMS TO TEST

* Test that weekly collect seems to work appropriately
* Test that daily collect seems to work appropriately
* Check that incremental backup works before and after .sha file exists

BUGS TO FIX

* Figure out what is the cause of the 'name to long > 100' error
* Figure out why incremental backups don't seem to pay any attention to the digest on disk
* Ignore file isn't configured
* Why does digest have only 25 entries if list for boot has 26 entries?
* AAARGH.  Purge removed collect directory.

TESTS TO ADD

* Create tests for creating tarfile with extremely long names (> 100 for link, > 256 for file)


ITEMS THAT SHOULD BE DONE BUT NEED TESTING

* Build some unit tests for generic action-related code


ADMINISTRATIVE

* Decide (maybe ask the list) whether it's important to list every file that is backed up
* Clean up home debbuild environment (not really Cedar Backup - just noticed it)
* Do a bunch of sample runs to get the logging level right (difference between "normal" and debug...?)
* Come up with a standard svn label script to do releases, so I can't forget as easily.
* Backport Python 2.3 and Python XML for 2.3 to woody to support 1.0.  Couldn't we have released sooner?


DOCUMENTATION

* Rewrite Cedar Backup webpage online, to show new version and link to old version.
* Add documentation for --stack option  (don't leave it undocumented)
* Maybe add --stack to notes on how to report bugs, i.e. if you get an error that doesn't make sense, re-run with --stack
* Change "1500" unit tests to "1700" unit tests everywhere I mention it.

* Write some sort of "what's new" paragraph for release of 2.0beta1
   - Entire codebase has been rewritten from the ground up using Python 2.3.
   - Cleaner, more pythonic, better structured, sensible mix of classes and functions
   - Much of the lower-level is intended to be general-purpose "library" code
   - All lower-level functionality is thoroughly regression tested via pyunit (1700+ individual unit tests)
   - Configuration class is standardized, so third-party Python programs can use it.
   - Uses Python's integrated logging for realtime logs, much better than old logs.
   - Uses Python's tar module rather than GNU tar via pipes, for more consistent behavior.
   - Internal use of pipes should now be more robust and less prone to problems.
   - New concept of extension modules and support for them.
   - Documentation has been completely rewritten
   - Document that we have dropped support for the tarz format (.tar.Z).
   - Runtime 'validate' action now checks many more things
   - Actions are now names not -- switches
   - Unicode files are now natively supported without a need for user settings at the site level


FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY

* Implement capacity mode functionality, i.e. what to do with a full disc. (bug #6)
* Implement "safe overwrite" functionality based on disc label, and give users a way to label a disc (bug #5)
* Prevent two backups from running against the same config file (?)
* Make incremental backup safer if full is missed, i.e. "expire" incremental stuff after a week? (bug #6)
* Somehow figure out if a full backup (i.e. disc-restart) has been missed (bug #6)
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two extensions with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).
* Perhaps update configuration to disallow two peers with same name (right now, behavior is undefined).
