* Change sort order of parameters, classes within modules, etc. where needed in Epydoc
* Implement a removeUnchanged() method on the backup files list, taking same as its digest output
* Put a check somewhere (not in the CD writer) to make sure the device isn't mounted
* PurgeItemList needs to match up better with requirements of purge action (i.e. way to purge files of a certain age)
