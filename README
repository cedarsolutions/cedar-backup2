Cedar Backup is a Python package that supports backups of files on local
and remote hosts to CD-R or CD-RW media over a secure network connection.
Cedar Backup also includes extensions that understand how to back up MySQL
databases and Subversion repositories, and it can be easily extended to
support other data sources, as well.

The package is focused around weekly backups to a single disc, with the
expectation that the disc will be changed or overwritten at the beginning
of each week.  If your hardware is new enough, Cedar Backup can write
multisession discs, allowing you to add to a disc in a daily fashion.
Directories are backed up using tar and may be compressed using gzip or
bzip2.

This is release 2 of the Cedar Backup package.  It represents a complete
rewrite of the original package.  The new code is cleaner, more compact,
more focused and also more "pythonic" in its approach (although the coding
style has arguably been influenced by my experiences with Java over the
last few years).  There is also now an extensive unit test suite, something
the first release always lacked.
