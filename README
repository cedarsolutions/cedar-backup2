Cedar Backup is a Python package that supports secure backups of files
on local and remote hosts to CD-R or CD-RW media.  The package is
focused around weekly backups to a single disc, with the expectation
that the disc will be changed or overwritten at the beginning of each
week.  If your hardware is new enough, the script can write multisession
discs, allowing you to add to a disc in a daily fashion.  Directories
are backed up using GNU tar(1) and may be compressed using several
different methods.
