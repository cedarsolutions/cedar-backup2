Mac os x notes 

Tested with my new (August 2005) iBook G4 running 10.4 (Tiger).
   
   1 collect works fine
   2 stage works fine
   3 purge works fine
   4 store has some issues - the code all works, but you
     end up really having to fight the OS so it gets allowed to work

      a. the drive identifies itself as having a tray, but doesn't
      b. the Fink eject program doesn't really work (it hangs)
      c. OS X insists on having control of every disc via the Finder
   
   Users will have to put in a dummy override for eject, maybe to /bin/echo
   or something, for the write to succeed.  Either that, or I'll have to
   put in some option to override the eject indentification for the drive
   (ugh!, though maybe eventually other people will need this, too?)

   Users will need to run a script to stop/start the automount daemon
   before running cback.  However, beware!  If you stop this daemon, the
   soft eject button apparently stops working!  It gets worse - you can't
   mount the disk to do a consistency check (even using hdiutil) when the
   automount daemon is stopped.  The utility just doesn't respond.

   I think that basically, we're going to have to not recommend using the
   store command on Mac OS X unless someone with some more expertise can
   help out with this.  The OS just gets too much in the way.  At the
   least, we need to document this stuff and put in some code warnings.

   Might want to reference XCDRoast stuff:

      http://www.xcdroast.org/xcdr098/xcdrosX.html

   The file README.macosX from the cdrtools distribution also contains
   some useful information in it, that we might be able to incorporate
   into the manual at some point.
