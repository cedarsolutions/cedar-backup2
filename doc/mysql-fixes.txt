Hello,

quick note: you do not need to expose mysql passwords when running
mysqldump. There is a better solution -- you create an additional mysql
configuration file (which may include the connection username and
password), make that readable by root only, and use that in your
mysqldump invocation.

Debian does the same thing in its standard mysql packaging, to provide a
safe root-only database shutdown.

For additional security I'd create a new mysql user for that; you can
restrict that user WRT the databases it sees (and to select-only access
on them), which is something you shouldn't really do to the database
root user. ;-)
