In here is code that I'm thinking of as "future functionality", i.e. prototype
code that might be used in the future.

prune* : code for pruning an ISO image.  

   Works with sarge's mkisofs, but fails with woody's.  Seems to have something
   to do with mkisofs following soft links to directories in the old version,
   but not the new version.  The problem manifests itself as conflicting
   rock-ridge names because we're effectively putting the same file into the
   image twice after the expansion step.  One fix might be to ignore all soft
   links - however, I'm not using this functionality now and I don't care to
   fix it before the 2.0 release.
