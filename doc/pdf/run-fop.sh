# Language : Bourne Shell
# Project  : Cedar Backup, release 2
# Purpose  : Wrapper script to run the fop program for PDF and Postscript
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# This script was originally taken from the Subversion project's book
# (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/).  I have not made any modifications to
# the script for use with Cedar Backup.
#
# The original script was (c) 2000-2004 CollabNet (see CREDITS).

# run-fop: Attempt to run fop (or fop.sh), fail articulately otherwise.
#
# Usage:    run-fop.sh BOOK_TOP [FOP_ARGS...]
#
# This script is meant to be invoked by subversion/doc/book/Makefile.
# The first argument is the top of the book directory, that is,
# subversion/doc/book (*not* subversion/doc/book/book), and the
# remaining arguments are passed along to `fop'.

BOOK_TOP=${1}

  echo "usage:  run-fop.sh BOOK_TOP [FOP_ARGS...]"
  exit 1

  export FOP_HOME

# Unfortunately, 'which' seems to behave slightly differently on every
# platform, making it unreliable for shell scripts.  Just do it inline
# instead.  Also, note that we search for `fop' or `fop.sh', since
# different systems seem to package it different ways.
