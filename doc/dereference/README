In here is the beginnings of a solution to Dmitry's "dereference" feature
request.  It doesn't work properly.  I think that the tests are pretty good,
but getting the code to work has been more of a challenge than I had
anticipated.

I've taken this out of the codebase because I want to get 2.17.1 released
with at least the fix for the link issue.  Then, I can spend some more time
on this feature request later.
