.TH cback\-span "1" "July 2010" "Cedar Backup" "Kenneth J. Pronovici"
.SH NAME
cback\-span \- Span staged data among multiple discs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cback\-span
[\fIswitches\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the Cedar Backup span tool.  It is intended for use by people who back
up more data than can fit on a single disc.  It allows a user to split (span)
staged data between more than one disc.  It can't be a Cedar Backup extension
in the usual sense because it requires user input when switching media.
.PP
Generally, one can run the cback\-span command with no arguments.  This will
start it using the default configuration file, the default log file, etc.  You
only need to use the switches if you need to change the default behavior.
.PP
This command takes most of its configuration from the Cedar Backup
configuration file, specifically the store section.  Then, more information is
gathered from the user interactively while the command is running.
.SH SWITCHES
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage/help listing.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print verbose output to the screen as well writing to the logfile. When this
option is enabled, most information that would normally be written to the
logfile will also be written to the screen.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR
Specify the path to an alternate configuration file.  The default configuration
file is /etc/cback.conf.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-logfile\fR
Specify the path to an alternate logfile.  The default logfile file is
/var/log/cback.log.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-owner\fR
Specify the ownership of the logfile, in the form user:group.  The default
ownership is root:adm, to match the Debian standard for most logfiles.  This
value will only be used when creating a new logfile.  If the logfile already
exists when the cback script is executed, it will retain its existing ownership
and mode.  Only user and group names may be used, not numeric uid and gid
values.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mode\fR
Specify the permissions for the logfile, using the numeric mode as in chmod(1).
The default mode is 640 (\-rw\-r\-\-\-\-\-).  This value will only be used when
creating a new logfile.  If the logfile already exists when the cback script is
executed, it will retain its existing ownership and mode.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR
Record some sub-command output to the logfile. When this option is enabled, all
output from system commands will be logged. This might be useful for debugging
or just for reference. Cedar Backup uses system commands mostly for dealing
with the CD recorder and its media.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Write debugging information to the logfile. This option produces a high volume
of output, and would generally only be needed when debugging a problem. This
option implies the \-\-output option, as well.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stack\fR
Dump a Python stack trace instead of swallowing exceptions.  This forces Cedar
Backup to dump the entire Python stack trace associated with an error, rather
than just progating last message it received back up to the user interface.
Under some circumstances, this is useful information to include along with a
bug report.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
This command returns 0 (zero) upon normal completion, and six other error
codes related to particular errors. 
.TP
\fB1\fR
The Python interpreter version is < 2.5.
.TP
\fB2\fR
Error processing command\-line arguments.
.TP
\fB3\fR
Error configuring logging.
.TP
\fB4\fR
Error parsing indicated configuration file.
.TP
\fB5\fR
Backup was interrupted with a CTRL\-C or similar.
.TP
\fB6\fR
Other error during processing.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Cedar Backup itself is designed to run as root, since otherwise it's difficult
to back up system directories or write the CD or DVD device.  However, this
command can be run safely as any user that has read access to the Cedar Backup
staging directories and write access to the CD or DVD device.
