All of the docbook functionality is based around a Debian system (or a
system with equivalent functionality) as the development system.

The following items need to be installed to build the user manual:

   apt-get install docbook-xsl
   apt-get install xsltproc
   apt-get install fop

Then, to make images work from within PDF, you need to get the Jimi
image library:

   get jimi1_0.tar.Z from http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/
   tar -Zxvf jimi1_0.tar.Z 
   cp Jimi/examples/AppletDemo/JimiProClasses.jar /usr/share/java/jimi-1.0.jar 

You also need a working XML catalog on your system, because the various
DTDs and stylesheets depend on that.  There's no point in harcoding paths
and keeping local copies of things if the catalog can do that for you.
However, if you don't have a catalog, you can probably force things to
work.  See notes at the top of the various files in util/docbook.
