All of the docbook functionality is based around a Debian system (or a
system with equivalent functionality) as the development system.  

I built the entire docbook infrastructure based on the Subversion book:

   http://svnbook.red-bean.com
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.0.x/doc/book/

The following items need to be installed to build the user manual:

   apt-get install docbook-xsl
   apt-get install xsltproc
   apt-get install fop
   apt-get install sp   # for nsgmls

Then, to make images work from within PDF, you need to get the Jimi
image library:

   get jimi1_0.tar.Z from http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/
   tar -Zxvf jimi1_0.tar.Z 
   cp Jimi/examples/AppletDemo/JimiProClasses.jar /usr/share/java/jimi-1.0.jar 

You also need a working XML catalog on your system, because the various
DTDs and stylesheets depend on that.  There's no point in harcoding paths
and keeping local copies of things if the catalog can do that for you.
However, if you don't have a catalog, you can probably force things to
work.  See notes at the top of the various files in util/docbook.

The util/validate script is a think wrapper around the nsgmls validating
parser.  I took the syntax directly from the Subversion book documentation.

   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.0.x/doc/book/README

You should run 'make validate' against the manual before checking it in.
