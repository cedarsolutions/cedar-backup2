   Class representing a device that knows how to write some kinds of DVD media.

   Summary
   =======

      This is a class representing a device that knows how to write some kinds
      of DVD media.  It provides common operations for the device, such as
      ejecting the media and writing data to the media.

      This class is implemented in terms of the C{eject}, C{growisofs} and
      C{dvd+rw-mediainfo} utilities, all of which should be available on most
      UN*X platforms.

   Image Writer Interface
   ======================

      The following methods make up the "image writer" interface shared
      with other kinds of writers::

         __init__
         initializeImage()
         addImageEntry()
         writeImage()
         setImageNewDisc()
         retrieveCapacity()
         getEstimatedImageSize()

      Only these methods will be used by other Cedar Backup functionality
      that expects a compatible image writer.
   
      The media attribute is also assumed to be available.

      Unlike the C{CdWriter}, the C{DvdWriter} can only operate in terms of
      filesystem devices, not SCSI devices.  So, although the constructor
      interface accepts a SCSI device parameter for the sake of compatibility,
      it's not used.

   Media Types
   ===========

      This class knows how to write to DVD+R and DVD+RW media, represented
      by the following constants:

         - C{MEDIA_DVDPLUSR}: DVD+R media (4.4 GB capacity)
         - C{MEDIA_DVDPLUSRW}: DVD+RW media (4.4 GB capacity)

      The difference is that DVD+RW media can be rewritten, while DVD+R media
      cannot be (although at present, C{DvdWriter} does not really
      differentiate between rewritable and non-rewritable media).

      The capacities are 4.4 GB because Cedar Backup deals in "true" gigabytes
      of 1024*1024*1024 bytes per gigabyte.

      The underlying C{growisofs} utility does support other kinds of media
      (including DVD-R, DVD-RW and BlueRay) which work somewhat differently
      than standard DVD+R and DVD+RW media.  I don't support these other kinds
      of media because I haven't had any opportunity to work with them.  The
      same goes for dual-layer media of any type.

   Device Attributes vs. Media Attributes
   ======================================

      As with the cdwriter functionality, a given dvdwriter instance has two
      different kinds of attributes associated with it.  I call these device
      attributes and media attributes.

      Device attributes are things which can be determined without looking at
      the media.  Media attributes are attributes which vary depending on the
      state of the media.  In general, device attributes are available via
      instance variables and are constant over the life of an object, while
      media attributes can be retrieved through method calls.

      Compared to cdwriters, dvdwriters have very few attributes.  This is due
      to differences between the way C{growisofs} works relative to
      C{cdrecord}.

   Media Capacity
   ==============

      One major difference between the C{cdrecord}/C{mkisofs} utilities used by
      the cdwriter class and the C{growisofs} utility used here is that the
      process of estimating remaining capacity and image size is more
      straightforward with C{cdrecord}/C{mkisofs} than with C{growisofs}.

      In this class, remaining capacity is calculated by asking doing a dry run
      of C{growisofs} and grabbing some information from the output of that
      command.  Image size is estimated by asking the C{IsoImage} class for an
      estimate and then adding on a "fudge factor" determined through
      experimentation.

   Testing
   =======

      It's rather difficult to test this code in an automated fashion, even if
      you have access to a physical DVD writer drive.  It's even more difficult
      to test it if you are running on some build daemon (think of a Debian
      autobuilder) which can't be expected to have any hardware or any media
      that you could write to.

      Because of this, some of the implementation below is in terms of static
      methods that are supposed to take defined actions based on their
      arguments.  Public methods are then implemented in terms of a series of
      calls to simplistic static methods.  This way, we can test as much as
      possible of the "difficult" functionality via testing the static methods,
      while hoping that if the static methods are called appropriately, things
      will work properly.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than no
      testing at all.

      passed in, it will be saved for reference purposes only.

      We have no way to query the device to ask whether it has a tray or can be
      safely opened and closed.  So, the C{noEject} flag is used to set these
      values.  If C{noEject=False}, then we assume a tray exists and open/close
      is safe.  If C{noEject=True}, then we assume that there is no tray and
      open/close is not safe.
