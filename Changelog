Version 2.4.0	02 Apr 2005

	* Re-license manual under "GPL with clarifications" to satisfy DFSG.
	* Rework our unmount solution again to try and fix observed problems.

	  - We try to work around this by making repeated unmount attempts.
	  - This logic is now encapsulated in util.mount() and util.unmount().
	  - This solution should also be more portable to non-Linux systems.
